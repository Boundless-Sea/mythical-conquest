			<h4>CREATING A SUMMONER</h4>
			<p>When creating a crusader, first consider a cause. Is your crusader a religious cultist fighting against the evil, the good, unholy other? Are they a lawful abider of their codes or are they chaotic marauders who pillage the opposing army cities? Crusaders often are very able to speak and rally people's spirits so keep that in mind when making a personality.</p>
