			<p>Crusaders fight for what they believe is right. Usually that means slamming a mace in the wrong party's face and raiding their towns and sacking their temples before building your own place.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A SUMMONER</h4>
			<p>When creating a crusader, first consider a cause. Is your crusader a religious cultist fighting against the evil, the good, unholy other? Are they a lawful abider of their codes or are they chaotic marauders who pillage the opposing army cities? Crusaders often are very able to speak and rally people's spirits so keep that in mind when making a personality.</p>
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a Crusader quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Charisma. Second, choose the Soldier or Noble background.</p>
