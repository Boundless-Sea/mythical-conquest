			<p>This ominous armor was obviously crafted by someone with an affinity for the undead. You gain a +3 bonus to AC while attuned to this magic armor. Additionally, you are immune to the poisoned condition and have immunity to poison damage. This armor can only be attuned by spellcasters.</p>
			<p><strong>Legendary Resistance (1/day):</strong> While attuned to this armor, if you fail a saving throw you can choose to succeed instead.</p>
			<p><strong>From Power, Death (1/day):</strong> When you roll damage for any spell you cast, you can add an amount of necrotic damage equal to half of your current hitpoints.</p>
			<p><strong>From Life, Power:</strong> When you cast a spell, you can choose to expend hit points instead of a spell slot. When you do so, roll a number of d4s equal to the spell's level. Lower your total maximum hit points by an amount equal to the roll. Lost maximum hit points are recovered on completion of a long rest. If this effect would lower your maximum hitpoints to 0, the spell fails to cast.</p>
			<p><strong>Curse.</strong> This armor is cursed and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. While cursed, you have disadvantage on death saving throws. If you die while attuned to this armor you cannot be resurrected by any means other than a wish spell. Additionally you arise as a zombie in 1d4 hours after death.</p>
